# Messy Kitty

A game where you try to get an old grandma's *out of control cat*
away from creating a mess.

## Installation

First, you need Python 3. It's probably installed on your system already.
Then, you need to install *pygame* and the game's dependencies.

Using **pip**:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
